A Palindrome is a word, phrase, or sequence that reads the same backward as forward.
For Example, the following items are palindromes:
    - Tenet 
    - Bird rib
    - Racecar
    - Mom
   
This program will determine if a given integer is a palindrome number (i.e. 777, 1001001, 666, etc,.)

    # Change integer to a string, and compare it to its reversed string.
    # Use `abs()` method to account for negative integers.
    return str(abs(n)) == str(abs(n))[::-1]
